# Backend: File Processing API

This backend project is an **ASP.NET Core** Web API designed to handle file uploads, process their contents, and return the results. It leverages the power of the .NET framework for robust and scalable server-side development.

## Overview

Key functionalities and features include:
- **File Upload Endpoint**: Accepts file uploads (e.g., text files) using a `POST` request.
- **Text Processing**: Identifies the most frequent word in the uploaded file and transforms it by wrapping each occurrence.
- **JSON Response**: Returns a concise JSON payload containing the processed text.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET 6 or higher** is required to run and build this project.

If you need to install or upgrade your .NET SDK, visit the [official .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally for development and testing:

### 1. Restore Dependencies
```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 2. Run the Application
```bash
dotnet run
```
By default, this starts a local development server accessible at http://localhost:8000

## Building for Production
To create an optimized production build, run:
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish
```

This generates a compiled version of your application in the publish folder. You can then deploy these files to your chosen hosting environment or containerize them using Docker.

## Additional Configuration
Environment Variables (Optional):
If you need to configure environment-specific settings (e.g., connection strings, logging levels), you can use .env files or environment variables. ASP.NET Core supports various configuration providers out of the box.
